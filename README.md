# Mapping_Earthquakes

Check out the cool map I made! It is looking at earthquakes around the world and also hilights where the tectonic plates are. You can see the correlation between the two. There is also a feature to look at the major quakes which have been recorded. If the light setting is too hard on your eyes, you can set the map background to the dark function and watch those colors really pop!
